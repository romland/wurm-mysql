#
# WHO IS THIS FOR?
# """"""""""""""""
# Sqlite is a fine piece of software, hands down. If you do not know why you
# would want MySQL in place of it, this is most likely NOT something you
# should install on your server.
#
# I started this project because we had around a dozen million objects in our
# item database, so I got grand plans to make Zenath handle that kind of
# database comfortably. But yes, ... plans ... WTB time and money for hobby
# projects. :)
#
# Note that this definitely has its uses without additional tweaks to Wurm.
#
# It comes without warranty.

#
#
# INSTALLATION
# """"""""""""
# 1.	In the game world's wurm.ini file:
#		Enter connection settings to your MySQL server. The fields are:
#			DB_HOST=<probably 127.0.0.1 or localhost>
#			DB_PORT=<probably 3306>
#			DB_USER=<a username>
#			DB_PASS=<that username's password>
#
# 2.	This is probably already set to true, but verify that this setting
#		is indeed true when you install the mod:
#			CREATE_TEMPORARY_DATABASE_INDICES_AT_STARTUP=true
#
#		You probably want to change to false at subsequent restarts or you 
#		will get some (harmless) errors saying indices already exists.
#
#		Save and close wurm.ini
#
# 3.	Copy .jar files in lib into /Wurm Unlimited/WurmServerLauncher/lib/
#
# 4.	Other than that, install like any other server mod:
#		- Copy folder mysql into mods
#		- Copy file mysql.properties into mods
#
# 5.	Make sure you check the settings below before starting the server.
#
#
# OPTIMIZING
# """"""""""
# Optimizing your MySQL install and databases is beyond the scope of this
# mod. Note that chances are it is a bit slower than Sqlite by default.
#
# What you get is a lot more options to optimize things (especially larger 
# databases). Personally I want to use MySQL to get more logging, 
# transparency and not have to worry about filelocks. A nice bonus is 
# naturally that I can have external applications fetch data from the game
# a bit easier.
#
#
# CHANGING A LIVE DATABASE
# """"""""""""""""""""""""
# In 99% of all cases you will not be able to write to a live database and
# have the changes propagate into the game properly, simply because your
# Wurm server put a lot of data into memory when it starts up. You'd still 
# need to restart your server if you make changes (or have MySQL trigger a
# reload of the data in the game, but that's a whole different can of worms).
#
# IMPORTING AN EXISTING WORLD
# """""""""""""""""""""""""""
# This is actually beyond the scope of this mod as there are plenty of 
# tools out there that can help you with this.
#
# You can simply google "sqlite to MySQL" or have a look at this if you 
# are comfortable with getting your hands dirty:
# http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18671/quick-easy-way-to-migrate-sqlite3-to-MySQL
#
# Setting insertDefaultDataInNewDatabases=true in the settings below
# will create an empty working world, though.
#
classname=com.friya.wurmonline.server.mysql.Mod
classpath=mysql.jar


# Description:	Whether this mod uses a shared class loader
# Notes:		
# Recommended:	Must be true.
sharedClassLoader=true


# Description:	Set to false to completely disable this mod.
# Notes:		
# Recommended:	true
enabled=true


# Description:	The name of the folder your game map and database recide in.
# Notes:		You MUST fill this in to a value of your own.
#				This is the folder we will place the modsupport.db and where
#				we will load database scripts from.
# Recommended:	(e.g. Creative, Adventure, ...)
gameName=Creative_org


# Description:	Create MySQL databases if they do not exist.
# Notes:		Have to be set to true when you first install the mod. Keeping 
#				it at true at subsequent restarts will not do any harm as it
#				will only create databases if they did not exist.
# Recommended:	true
createDatabasesIfTheyDoNotExist=true


# Description:	When MySQL databases are created, should we create the tables?
# Notes:		Must be true when you first install the mod. Keeping it at 
#				true will not do any harm as this will only happen if a 
#				database was created.
# Recommended:	true
createTablesOnDatabaseCreation=true


# Description:	Insert default data into new MySQL databases. 
# Notes:		This will only happen to databases that were just created.
# 				If you are importing an existing world, set to false.
# 				If you are creating a world from scratch, set to true.
# Recommended:	true
insertDefaultDataInNewDatabases=true


# Description:	Import world "gameName" into MySQL
# Notes:		Set this OR insertDefaultDataInNewDatabases to true to create
#				a world in MySQL. If both of importExistingWorld and 
#				insertDefaultDataInNewDatabases are set to false you have to 
#				have data in your database or the server will not start up.
# Recommended:	n/a
#
# NOT IMPLEMENTED, SEE "IMPORTING AN EXISTING WORLD" AT THE TOP OF THIS FILE!
#
importExistingWorld=false


# Description:	Name of modsupport database.
# Notes:		Ago's modloader creates a Sqlite database. We will keep it
#				intact and USE, you can specify the name of that database 
#				here. It is probably recommended that you do not use the 
#				default name of 'modsupport.db' in case something goes wrong 
#				in the transition from Sqlite.
#				If you are importing a world into MySQL, a copy will be made
#				from modsupport.db to this name.
#				Individual mods can of course choose to use MySQL, but by 
#				default they will use Sqlite.
# Recommended:	modsupport-with-MySQL.db
modSupportDbName=modsupport-with-mysql.db


# Description:	Delete all Wurm related data, tables and databases in MySQL.
# Notes:		Use if you want a new world or something went wrong with 
#				creating your old world. I use this mostly for testing.
# WARNING:		You probably don't want to change this to true unless you are
#				sure what you are doing.
# Recommended:	false (really, keep at false)
deleteDatabasesIfTheyExist=false
