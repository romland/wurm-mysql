Install like any other mod (on the server). If I recall, Wurm Unlimited introduced some changes
that broke this, though. You will likely need to do some patches.

That said, there is little to no reason to use mysql in place of sqlite in Wurm Unlimited.

*Note: I KNOW this mod does not work in latest version of Wurm Unlimited.*
